# Glossary

This glossary defines common terms used throughout **Total Miner Forge** and the **TotalMiner Community Hub (TMCH)** documentation.

If a term is missing or unclear, it can be expanded as the community contributes.

---

## Area
A defined region of the world with its own permissions and rules.  
Areas are commonly used to protect spawns, systems, shops, or build zones.

---

## Area Permissions
Rules that apply only within a specific area.  
These permissions override global permissions while the player is inside the area.

---

## Admin
A player with elevated permissions that typically bypass many restrictions.  
Admins are useful for setup and moderation but should not be used for testing permissions or scripts.

---

## Creative Mode
A mode focused on building, testing, and development.  
Creative Mode removes many gameplay limitations but **still respects permissions and area restrictions**.

---

## Creative Tools
Special tools available in Creative Mode that allow faster building, editing, or testing.  
These tools are usually restricted due to their power.

---

## Execution Context
The environment in which a script runs, including:
- who triggered it
- where it is running
- what permissions apply

Most scripts execute with the permissions of the triggering player.

---

## Global Permissions
Permissions that apply everywhere in the world unless overridden by area permissions.

---

## Guest / Visitor
A permission level typically used for new or untrusted players.  
Guests usually have limited interaction and building abilities.

---

## Inheritance
The concept that higher permission levels include the abilities of lower levels, unless explicitly restricted.

---

## Moderator
A trusted role often used to help manage players and enforce rules without full administrative control.

---

## Override
A permission rule that takes priority over another rule.  
Area permissions commonly override global permissions.

---

## Permission Level
A grouped set of permissions that defines what a player can do.  
Examples include Guest, Player, Moderator, and Admin.

---

## Protected Area
An area where building, interaction, or modification is restricted to prevent damage or abuse.

---

## Script
A piece of logic that reacts to events, triggers, or player actions to create custom behavior in a world.

---

## Script Trigger
The condition that causes a script to run, such as entering an area, interacting with an object, or activating a system.

---

## Silent Failure
When an action or script fails without showing an error.  
This is often caused by permission or area restrictions.

---

## Survival Mode
The standard gameplay mode where players gather resources, manage health, and follow normal progression rules.

---

## TMCH
Short for **TotalMiner Community Hub**, the community-driven documentation project for Total Miner Forge.
