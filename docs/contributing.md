# Contributing to TMCH

**TotalMiner Community Hub (TMCH)** is a community-driven documentation project.  
Its quality depends on shared knowledge, testing, and small improvements over time.

You do **not** need to be an expert to contribute.

---

## Why contribute?

Many Total Miner systems are:
- poorly documented
- explained only in chat messages
- learned through trial and error

Contributing helps:
- prevent knowledge from being lost
- make systems easier to understand
- reduce repeated questions
- improve world stability and server management

Even small changes matter.

## What you can contribute

You can help TMCH by:

- fixing typos or grammar
- clarifying confusing explanations
- adding examples or edge cases
- expanding incomplete sections
- documenting discoveries from testing
- suggesting new pages or topics

You don’t need to write entire pages — **small improvements are encouraged**.

---

## How to contribute (simple method)

The easiest way to contribute is directly through GitHub.

1. Navigate to the page you want to improve  
2. Click **Edit this page**  
3. Make your changes  
4. Submit the pull request  

That’s it.

You don’t need to clone the repo or install anything locally.

## How to contribute via Discord

If you’re not comfortable editing files:

- Share discoveries in Discord
- Point out incorrect or outdated info
- Suggest topics that need documentation

Documentation improvements often start as Discord discussions.

---

## Contribution guidelines

To keep the docs consistent and useful:

### Be accurate
Only document behavior you have:
- tested
- observed repeatedly
- or verified through reliable sources

Avoid assumptions.

---

### Be clear
Explain **why** something behaves the way it does, not just **what** happens.

---

### Avoid speculation
If something is uncertain:
- state that clearly
- or leave it undocumented until confirmed

---

### Keep it version-agnostic
Avoid hardcoding:
- exact UI labels
- menu paths that may change
- version-specific behavior unless necessary

---

## Style and tone

TMCH documentation aims to be:
- neutral
- clear
- practical
- community-focused

Avoid:
- slang
- jokes that obscure meaning
- unnecessary complexity

---

## Reviewing contributions

Contributions may be:
- accepted as-is
- edited for clarity
- discussed for accuracy

Feedback is part of improving quality, not rejecting effort.

---

## Reporting issues

If you find a problem but don’t want to edit it yourself:
- open an issue on GitHub
- or report it in Discord

Be specific about:
- what is incorrect
- what you expected
- where the issue appears

---

## Code and scripts

TMCH documentation may include:
- example scripts
- pseudo-code
- configuration explanations

When contributing script-related content:
- explain context
- note permission requirements
- avoid assuming admin access

---

## Recognition

Contributors help shape TMCH.

While there is no formal ranking system:
- contributors are appreciated
- consistent helpers may be recognized in the community
- documentation improves because of you

---

## Final note

TMCH exists because people choose to share what they learn.

If you’ve ever figured something out the hard way,  
consider documenting it so someone else doesn’t have to.

Thank you for contributing.
