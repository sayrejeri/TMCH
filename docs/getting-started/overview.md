Welcome to the **TotalMiner Community Hub (TMCH)**.

## What TMCH is

TMCH is a centralized reference for understanding how Total Miner works beyond basic gameplay.

It focuses on:
- permissions and access control
- Creative Mode and Creative tools
- scripting behavior and limitations
- world setup and configuration
- community-discovered mechanics

TMCH is **not official documentation**, but it aims to be clear, accurate, and practical.

---

## What TMCH is not

TMCH is not:
- a mod loader or plugin system
- a step-by-step survival guide
- a replacement for in-game tutorials
- official developer documentation

Instead, it explains **how systems behave** and **why things work the way they do**.
