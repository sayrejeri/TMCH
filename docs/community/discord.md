## What the Discord is for

The Discord exists to:
- ask questions about mechanics, permissions, and scripting
- discuss discoveries and edge cases
- suggest documentation improvements
- get help when something isn’t working
- connect with other creators and server owners

It complements the documentation — it does not replace it.

## How to ask good questions

When asking for help, include:
- what you’re trying to do
- what you expect to happen
- what actually happens
- permission level involved
- whether the area is protected

Clear details lead to faster, better answers.

## Documentation workflow

The typical flow looks like this:
1. A question or issue comes up in Discord  
2. The answer is discussed or discovered  
3. The documentation is updated to reflect it  

This keeps knowledge from being lost in chat history.
