# TotalMiner Community Hub

Welcome to the **TotalMiner Community Hub (TMCH)** — a community-driven documentation site for **Total Miner Forge**.

This site exists to make Total Miner’s systems easier to understand by organizing community knowledge into clear, readable documentation. Whether you’re new to the game or deep into creative and scripting, TMCH aims to give you reliable explanations without unnecessary complexity.

---

## What this site covers

TMCH focuses on documenting systems and mechanics that are often confusing, undocumented, or scattered across different sources, including:

- **Permissions** – how access control works and how permissions interact  
- **Creative Mode** – tools, behaviors, and creative mechanics  
- **Scripting** – scripting concepts, examples, and limitations  
- **Gameplay Systems** – mechanics explained in plain language  
- **Community Findings** – discoveries and behaviors learned through testing  

All content is written with clarity in mind and expanded as the community learns more.

---

## Who this is for

This site is for:
- Players learning how Total Miner systems actually work  
- Creative builders designing complex worlds  
- Scripters experimenting with automation and logic  
- Anyone tired of digging through old forum posts or Discord messages  

If you’ve ever thought *“why isn’t this written down anywhere?”* — this hub is for you.
