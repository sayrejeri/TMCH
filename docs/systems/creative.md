# Creative Mode

Creative Mode in **Total Miner Forge** provides advanced tools and freedoms for building, testing, and designing worlds without normal gameplay limitations.

It is commonly used for:
- large builds
- custom maps
- scripted systems
- testing mechanics
- server setup and configuration

Because of its power, Creative Mode is tightly controlled by **permissions** and **area restrictions**.

---

## What is Creative Mode?

Creative Mode removes or relaxes many survival constraints, such as:
- resource gathering
- block placement speed
- tool durability
- environmental risks

This allows creators to focus on **design and logic**, rather than progression.

Creative Mode is not simply “easy mode” — it is a **development environment**.

---

## Creative Mode vs Survival Mode

Creative Mode differs from Survival in several key ways:

| Feature | Creative Mode | Survival Mode |
|------|------|------|
| Resources | Unlimited | Gathered |
| Block placement | Instant | Limited |
| Tool durability | None | Yes |
| Permissions | Required | Required |
| Scripting behavior | More permissive | More restrictive |

Scripts and tools that work in Creative may fail in Survival if permissions or restrictions differ.

---

## Creative tools

Creative Mode often provides access to special tools that do not exist in Survival.

These tools may allow:
- mass block placement or removal
- copying and pasting structures
- selecting regions
- modifying terrain quickly
- testing scripts and triggers

Because these tools can easily damage a world, access is usually restricted to trusted users.

---

## Permissions and Creative Mode

Creative Mode does **not** ignore permissions.

Even in Creative:
- players can be restricted
- areas can be protected
- actions can be blocked

Common permission controls include:
- who can use creative tools
- where creative actions are allowed
- which players can enter creative areas

Always verify permission settings when Creative tools do not work as expected.

---

## Area restrictions in Creative Mode

Area-based permissions apply fully in Creative Mode.

This allows:
- protected spawn areas
- restricted system zones
- build-only regions
- testing areas

A player may be in Creative Mode and still be unable to:
- break blocks
- place blocks
- interact with objects

This is intentional and prevents accidental damage.

---

## Creative Mode and scripting

Creative Mode is commonly used to:
- test scripts
- prototype mechanics
- debug systems

However:
- scripts may behave differently outside Creative
- Creative permissions may hide issues
- Survival restrictions can cause scripts to fail later

**Always test scripts in their final intended environment.**

---

## Common Creative Mode issues

### “I’m in Creative but can’t build”
This is almost always caused by:
- area restrictions
- missing permissions
- protected regions

Check the area before changing permissions.

---

### “Creative tools aren’t working”
Possible causes:
- tool access is restricted
- player permissions are insufficient
- the area blocks creative actions

---

### “Everything works for me but not others”
Admins often bypass restrictions.
Test Creative behavior with:
- non-admin accounts
- restricted permission levels

---

## Best practices

### Separate build and play areas
Keep:
- Creative build zones
- Survival play zones
- system areas

separate and clearly defined.

---

### Lock down finished systems
Once a system is complete:
- remove Creative access
- protect the area
- restrict tools

This prevents accidental edits.

---

### Document Creative setups
For servers and shared worlds:
- document Creative zones
- document who has access
- document tool permissions

This avoids confusion later.

---

## When to use Creative Mode

Creative Mode is ideal for:
- world creation
- system design
- scripting and testing
- server configuration

It is not intended for:
- normal gameplay
- bypassing rules
- replacing permissions

Use Creative Mode as a **tool**, not a shortcut.

---

## Summary

Creative Mode is a powerful environment for building and development, but it relies on:
- permissions
- area restrictions
- careful testing

Understanding how Creative Mode interacts with Permissions and Scripting is key to stable worlds.
